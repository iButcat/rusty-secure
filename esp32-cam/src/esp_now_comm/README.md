# ESP-NOW Communication

This module isn't in used anymore. I wasn't able to get it to work reliably at the same time as the HTTP server. The communication was working though. We were able to have a communication between the ESP32 and the ESP32-CAM.

## TODO

- [ ] Remove this module
- [ ] Remove the dependencies on this module
